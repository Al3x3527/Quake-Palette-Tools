# Quake-Palette-Tools
tools to make palette files for the Quake engine or similar projects.

these tools will bring you from a 24-bit .bmp image of a 256 (255) color palette to usable .pal, .act, and .py palette files for use in various programs. (Wally, SLK_img2pixel, Quake MDL exporter for Blender)
the initial .bmp image could be made in Photoshop or MS Paint. I used the dimensions 8px x 32px for my starting image.
